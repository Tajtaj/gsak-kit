# GSAK-KIT 

This project provides a plugin for graph analysis and visualization through which you can easily embed, visualize, and analyze your data on any website or web page.<br>
GSAK-KIT is divided into two sections.
#### The server side 
  * **input** <br>text data or the built-in graph
  * **output**<br>processed graph.
  * **Description** <br>
 The server side will do all the data processing, graph generation, analysis, filteration, etc.
 When the server is provided with text data, it generates a graph based on specific keywords or relationships that exist   within the data.
 When the server is provided with the built-in graph, it will analyze and filter the graph to create another processed graph.  The server specifies formats for the input data. From this, the server generates the graph and provides a way to write your  own implementation code for the graph generator. 
  * **Third Party Libraries**<br> 
For graph processing we'll use the [GephiToolkit](https://gephi.org/toolkit/) <br>
For java web server we'll use the [Undertow](https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow) <br>
For logging we'll use [log4j2](https://github.com/logentries/le_java/wiki/Log4j2)

#### The front end side 
  * **input** <br> Processed graph data; 
  * **output** <br> Sigma graph 
  * **Description** <br> The front end will provide a way for visualizing the graph generated by the server. The front end will also provide a way to use the graph services utilized by the server in a webpage. 
  * **Technologies** <br> We are using Sigma js for front end visualization.
