# GSAK-KIT 

This project provides a plugin for graph analysis and visualization through which you can easily embed, visualize, and analyze your data on any website or web page.<br>
GSAK-KIT is divided into two sections.
#### The server side 
  * `input`: text data, the built-in graph
  * `output`: processed graph.
  * `Description`: The server side will do all the data processing, graph generation, analysis, filteration, etc.
When the server is provided with text data, it generates a graph based on specific keywords or relationships that exist within the data.
When the server is provided with the built-in graph, it will analyze and filter the graph to create another processed graph. The server specifies formats for the input data. From this, the server generates the graph and provides a way to write your own implementation code for the graph generator. 
  * `Technologies`: We use the Gephi toolkit for graph processing and Undertow as the java web server. We also use Apache log4j2 for logging 

#### The front end side 
  * `input`: Processed graph data; 
  * `output`: Sigma graph 
  * `Description`: The front end will provide a way for visualizing the graph generated by the server. The front end will also provide a way to use the graph services utilized by the server in a webpage. 
  * `Technologies`: We are using Sigma js for front end visualization.
